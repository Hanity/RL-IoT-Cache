# RL-IoT-Cache

WIth the increasing number of integration of IoT devices there is a need for sustainable caching that is suitable for IoT transient data.
The follwoing project contasins codes and evaluation for a collaborative edge caching network for IoT devices.

## The environment folder 
This folder contains codes for our proposed custom environmnet that mimics a two layer collaborative caching network.

## The monitor logs
This folder contains scerious of training and evaluation logs.

## the data set 
this dataset is used to simulate IoT data
